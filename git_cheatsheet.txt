				              Git Commands


    git init ------> create new empty git repository locally in current working directory
    git init <directory> ------> create new empty git repository locally in specified directory
    git init -b main/master -----> create new empty git repository with master or main branch


Low level git commands (not important):

    git hash-object -----> to create git object manually
    ex. echo 'hello' | git hash-object --stdin -w

    git cat-file -p <hash> ------> content of the object
    git cat-file -s <hash> ------> size of the object
    git cat-file -t <hash> ------> type of the object

    git mktree
    first create a file with object information
    ex. filename.txt
        permission_type obj_type <hash> filename1.txt
        permission_type obj_type <hash> filename2.txt
    then create tree
    ex. cat filename.txt | git mktree

    git read-tree <hash>
    staging files from git repository to staging area.

    git ls-files ----> list files from staging area
    git ls-files -s ----> list files from staging area with statistic

    git checkout-index -a
    staging file from staging area to working directory.


Configure git author name and git email

    git config --list/-l ------> list all configuration setting

    git config --global user.name <name> -----> configure username globally
    ex. git config --global user.name "shubham chavhan"

    git config --global user.email <email> -----> configure email globally
 
    git config user.name <name>   --|------> configure name/email locally
    git config user.email <email> --|


Basic git command

    git status ------> displays the state of the working directory and the staging area

    git add filename ------> add file to staging area from working directory
    git add . ------> add all modified/untrack files to staging area from current working directory.
    git add <directory> -----> add all modified/untrack files to staging area from specified working directory.

    git commit or git commit -m "messege" ------> add all changes from staging area to git repository.
    git commit -a -m "messege" ------> staging + commit

    git log -----> list history of previous commits
   
    git checkout <branch_name> ----> this will change the head position to provided branch
    git checkout <commit> ------> this will change the head position to provided hash(commit)

    git diff ----> show the changes made in working directory that have not been staged.
    git diff <hash1> <hash2> -----> show changes bewteen two commits


git branches

    branch is just reference to a commit. default branch is master.

    git branch or git branch --list -----> list all branch from local repositoy
    git branch -r/--remote -----> list all branch from remote repository
    git branch -a/--all -----> list all branch from both remote and local repository
    git branch -v -----> list branch with sha1 and  and commit subject line for each head.
    git branch -vv -----> list branch with sha1 and  and commit subject line for each head along with
                          corresponding upstream branch
    
    git branch -m <old_name> <new_name> -----> rename branch while pointing to any branch
    git branch -m <new_name>   ------> rename current checkout branch

    git branch <branch_name> -----> create new branch
    ex. git branch feature-1

    git branch <branch_name> <hash>/<target_brach_name> ----> will create a new branch at the provided hash or
							      branch name(target_brach_name)

    git checkout -b <branch_name> ------> creates a new branch and checkout newly created branch as well
    git checkout -b <branch_name> <hash>/<target_brach_name> ----> will create a new branch at the provided hash or
							      branch name(target_brach_name) and checkout new branch

    git branch -d <branch_name> ------> delete a branch with specified branch name.
    git branch -D <branch_name> ------> force delete branch


git merge

    git merge will integrate two diff branch into one.

    merging process:
  
        - create a new ex. feature1 branch from another branch(like master)
        - commit your changes to feature branch
        - checkout receiving branch in our case master branch
        - merge feature1 branch to current receiving branch(master)

    git merge <branch_name> -----> merge <branch_name> into current checkout branch
    ex. git merge feature1 -----> merge feature1 branch into master

    git merge <branch_name> -m "msg" -----> merge branches with merge messege

    git perform two types of merge depend on the commits made in both braches.
        
        - fast-forward merge -----> perform when receiving branch has no further commit. git simply
                                    move head position of receiving branch to merging branch
   
        - three-way-merge ------> perform when receiving branch has further commits. in this case git create
                                  a new commit which point to both receiving branch and merging branch and
                                  move head that commit.

        in three-way-merge extra merge commit will be created

    merge conflicts:

        - when same file or same code will change in both branch then, while performing merging, merge conflict
          will be created
        - you have to solve conflicts manually in that file or code
        - after solving conflicts you can mark them as resolved  by adding changes to staging area (git add .)
        - finally you can commit the chnages (git commit -m "messege"). at that point you will be able to switch 
          branches again

    git merge --abort -----> abort merge process when conflicts occur during merging.



git remote commands

    git clone <repository_url> -----> clone(copy) remote repository to local machine.

    [note] default name for git remote repository is origin. you can have multiple remote repository.

    git remote -----> show list of remote repository for local git repository
    git remote -v -----> show list of remote repository with fetch and push url
    git remote show <remote_name> -----> show remote repository with statistic
        ex. git remote show origin

    git remote add origin <remote_URL> ------> add remote repository with name origin.
    [note] when clone repository, no need to run this command.

    git remote remove <remote_repo_name> ------> remove remote repository.
	ex. git remote remove origin
   
    git fetch -----> fetch all the changes from remote repository to local repository.
                    git fetch only update local repo. it does not update staging area and working directory.
                    to update staging area and working directory you have run following command

    git merge FETCH_HEAD -----> it update all changes from local repository to staging area and working directory.

    git pull ------> git fetch + git merge FETCH_HEAD

    git push -----> push all local changes to remote repository

    git push --set-upstream <remote_name> <branch_name> or 
    git push -u <remote_name> <branch_name> ------> create remote branch based on local branch.
        ex. git push -u origin feature-1.
               
    git push origin -d <branch_name> -----> delete remote branch.

    git remote prune origin           |
    git fetch -p/--prune              |------> remove tracking of remote deleted branch locally
    git remote update origin --prune  |

    git show-ref -----> show references for local and remote
    git show-ref <branch_name> -----> show reference for perticular branch


storing username and password:

    if you use git push command then it will ask you a username and password every time you push a code, which is annoing.
    to avoid this you can store username and password in git credential.helper as follow.

	git config credential.helper cache ----> this will store credential locally default for 15 min. you can specify time as follow
	git config credential.helper "cache --timeout=3600" -----> this will store credential locally for 1h.
	git config credential.helper store --------> this will store credential locally permanently.

    if you want to store credential globally you have to use --global flag as follow.

	git config --global credential.helper store.

    [Note] - Don't set credential globally in store or cache if you have multiple github account on same machine.

    

storing username and password using git credential manager:

    if you use windows credential manager then git credential manager will store the same username and password on for all github account
							      which entered for the first time. this lead to pass same creadential across 
							      multiple account. to avoid this use fillowing command.
    
    git config --global credential.useHttpPath true ----> storing this config will save username and password for diff github repo
							  in credential manager. you have to enter creadential only once for first time.


git tags

    Git has the ability to tag specific points in a repository’s history as being important. Typically,
    people use this functionality to mark release points (v1.0, v2.0 and so on)

    git tag <tag_name> ------> create a lightweight tag
    ex. git tag v1.0.0 create tag to last commit to checkout branch

    git tag -a <tag_name> -m "messege" ------> create a anotated tag to last commit to checkout branch
    ex. git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "tag created"
    
    git tag <tag_name> <hash> ------> created tag to a specific commit to checkout branch
    ex. git tag v1.0.0 efg5a7

    git tag ------> to show list of all tag
    
    git show v1.0.0 ------> show details of a specific tag

    git tag -l "v1.*" -------> list all tags stating with v1.

    git push origin --tags or git push tags ------> push all tags created localy to a remote
    
    git push origin <tag_name> ------> push specific tag to remote
    ex. git push origin v1.0.0

    git tag -d <tag_name> ------> delete a specific tag locally
    ex. git tag -d v1.0.0
    
    git push origin -d <tag_name> -------> delete a specific tag from a remote repository

    git tag -d <tag_name> <tag_name> -------> delete multiple tag from locally
    ex. git tag -d v1.0.0 v1.0.1
    
    git push origin -d <tag_name> -------> delete multiple tag from remote
    ex. git push origin -d v1.0.0 v1.1.0

    [Note] ------> you can not checkout tags like branch or commit but you can create a branch
                   from a tag which will create a new branch with all changes with that commit

        git checkout -b <branch_name> <tag_name>


git rebase

    rebase is two step process:

        first, checkout branch which to be rebase
        ex. git checkout feature1

        and rebase branch on the top of the base branch
        ex. git rebase master

        second, checkout base branch into which merging to be done
        ex. git checkout master'

        and merge branch which to be rebase into base branch
        ex. git merge feature1

        [Merge preserves history whereas rebase rewrites it.]

        [note] while rebasing, conflicts may be occure. you have to resovle conflicts manually.
               after solving conflicts you can mark them as resolved by adding them to index(staging area)
               and continue rebasing by (git rebase --continue) command


detached head

    if you checkout to a specific commit, you are in detached head state. you can look around,
    make experimented changes and commit them. and you can discard any commit you make in this state
    without impacting any other branches by performing another checkout

    ex. git checkout a7ccf8

    if you want to retain experimental changes you can checkout by using -b command

    ex. git checkout -b <branch_name>


git advance
 
    git log advance-
    
        git log -5 -----> list no of history of previous commits
        git log --graph -------> list history of previous commits with graph representation
        git log --oneline -----> show commits in one line
        git log --stat -----> show log with statistic

        git lg -------> show pretty log(if not work set following config)
        alias for git lg:
            git config --global alias.lg "log --color --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr)%C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit"

    
        git shortlog -----> The git shortlog command is used to summarize the output of git log(default sorted
                            by author name) this shows author list with commit messege
        git shortlog -n -----> sorted by most commited author
        git shortlog -s -----> show author list with no of commits
        git shortlog -e -----> this shows author list with commit messege along with author email

        git log --author="author_name" -----> sort git log with author name
        git log --grep="keyword" -----> sort commit by any keyword user in commit messege

        git log --pretty=format:"format_string" -----> show formatted log
        ex. git log --pretty=format:"%cn %h" ------> shows log with commitor name and hash
        [note] you can find format string online

        git log --merges ------> show log of only merge commits
        git log --no-merges ------> show log of commits except merge commit

    git reset-

        reset are of three type
            1) soft
            2) mixed (default)
            3) hard

        
        git reset --soft <hash>  
             ------> this will discard the changes of commit upto given hash(commit)
                     but keep the changes of staging area and working directory.    
        
        git reset <hash> or git reset --mixed <hash>  
             ------> this will discard the changes of commit and staging area upto given hash(commit)
                     but keep the changes of working directory.

        git reset --hard <hash>  
             ------> this will discard the changes of working directory, staging area
                     and commit upto given hash(commit)

        git reset HEAD~5 -------> reset last five commits(default reset will apply)

        -if you pull after reset you will coming to original state.

        
        after changes you can push changes to remote repository by following command
        git push -f origin <branch_name>
            ex. git push -f origin master

        [note] only use reset if you are working on feature branch with no other collaborator
               it is not recommended to reset changes in public repo. and branches with other collaborator.
               use reset with precaution.


    git revert-
            
        git revert does not modify history like git reset. The git revert command is a forward-moving 
        undo operation that offers a safe method of undoing changes. instead of deleting or orphaning 
        commits in the commit history, a revert will create a new commit that inverses the changes specified.
        git revert is a safer alternative to git reset in regards to losing work

        git revert <hash> ------> revert the changes of specified hash(commit) by creating new commit
        ex git revert fg4d5dg
        
        git revert HEAD -------> revert last commit

    git amend-
        
        it is use to modify last commit. if this command use it will modify history(change hash of modified
        commit). not recommended to use in public repository.
 
        git commit --amend -m "messege"  -----> change last commit messege
  
        git commit --amend --author="author_name" ------> change last commit author details
        ex. git commit --amend --author="shubham chavhan <spchavhan32@gmail.com>"

	git commit --amend --no-edit -----> This is especially useful for if you forgot to add some changes in last commit
					    or when you want to add more changes without creating new commits by reusing the last commit.
                             

    git cherry-pick-

        The git cherry-pick command is used to take the change introduced in a single Git commit and 
        try to re-introduce it as a new commit on the branch you’re currently on. This can be useful to 
        only take one or two commits from a branch individually rather than merging in the branch which 
        takes all the changes.

        git cherry-pick <hash> ------> this pick a commit(specified hash) and append that commit to
                                       checkout brach as a new commit. [note] commit messege will remain same 
                                       after cherry-pick of that hash(commit).

        to change commit messege you can cherry-pick with --no-commit option. this will just stage the 
        changes, thens you can commit changes with new messege.

        git commit cherry-pick --no-commit 


    git reflog-

        
        git reflog will maintain record of all the movement of head. it only maintain record of local
        repository.

        git reflog -----> shows all logs of all branches

        git reflog show <branch_name> -----> show logs of specific branch


    git stashing-

        git stash temporarily save changes you've made to your working directory so you can 
        work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later on. Stashing is handy if you 
        need to quickly switch context and work on something else(like on another branch), but you're 
        mid-way through a code change and aren't quite ready to commit.

        git stash or git stash push -----> temporary save current working changes which to be commit

        git stash -m "msg" or git stash push -m "msg" -----> stash changes with messege

        git stash pop ------> git stash pop applies the top stashed element and removes it from the stack.

        git stash apply ------> git stash apply does the same as git pop but, leaves it in the stash stack.

        git stash list ------> list the stash object

        git stash show ----> show stash statistic

        git stash clear -----> clear all stash object

        git stash drop -----> drop top stash object
        git stash drop stash@{n} -------> drop specific stash

        By default, git stash will stash only modified and staged tracked files. to stash untrack file
        you have to use -u or --include-untracked option

        ex. git stash -u

        
    git squash-
   
        Git squash is a technique that helps you to take a series of commits and condense it to a few
        commits. For example, assume that you have a series of n commits. By squashing you can make all 
        the n-commits to a single commit.

        It is also used while merging branches. Most people will advise you to always squash the commits
        and rebase it with the parent branch (like master or develop).

        So when you are squashing and rebasing with the parent branch, the history of the main branch will
        be very clean and will have only meaningful commits.

        Remember that squashing will change the git history. So if you have already pushed the branch to 
        remote then it is not advisable to squash.

        to squash and rebase checkout to branch of which commit to squash and then run follwing command

        git rebase -i HEAD~<no_of_commit_to_squash> ---->  this will squash the last no of commit and rebase
                                                           the branch (-i stands for interactive rebase)

        ex. git rebase -i HEAD~4 ------> this will sqash the last four commit and rebase the branch.
	[note] before squash and merge above command will vim editor where you have to change pick 
               to s or sqash in insert mode of all except first.

	or git rebase -i <after-this-commit-sha1>

        you can then merge or rebase this branch into another branch like master.


git garbage collection:

    - garbage collection is used to cleanup unreachable(object that has no reference) objects and optimize the code.
    - garbage collection is triggered after some frequently used commands ex. pull fetch commit etc.

    you can run gc manually using following command

    git gc ----> will run garbage collector

    [Note] - garbage collector does not clean unreachable object if that object has entry in reflog. to do so you have
	 to manually remove entry from reflog as follow
 
    git reflog expire --expire-unreachable=now --all
    git gc --prune=now
